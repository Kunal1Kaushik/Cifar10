# Cifar10
The Major Project of my first course on Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning!
The Cifar 10 Dataset comtains images of 10 different classes and is commonly used to train Machine Learning algorithms, and it served as good practice for me!
Convolutional Neural Networks using TensorFlow were used to tackle the dataset, and while the accuracy might not be the best, it was my first real taste of CNNs, so be kind!
